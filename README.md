# MalonHolmes.github.io - Portfolio

A showcase of everything Malon! From my professional background in Computer Science to my creative passions and hobbies...welcome to my world...

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to showcase my diverse background and experiences, ranging from software engineering to my passion for graphics and photography. This portfolio serves as a visual representation of my work, projects, and professional experiences beyond what is included in my resume. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy accessibility.

## Features

- [x] A visually appealing layout with icons that represent my skills and interests (programming, graphic design, photography, DJing, etc.)
- [x] A gradient background that dynamically changes with scrolling, transitioning through different color schemes for each section.
- [ ] Implementation of various subtle icons and animations (lightning, stars, clouds, spirals, etc.) to enhance the overall aesthetic.
- [ ] Bold borders framing the entire page for a distinct and modern look.
- Interactive project section:
  - [ ] On hover, the background of each project dims, and the project name fades in to provide a seamless user experience.
  - [ ] On click, visitors are directed to individual project blog pages that contain detailed information about each project.
  - [ ] Each project also includes a link to its corresponding GitHub repository.
- [ ] A "Load More" functionality that allows visitors to view a full list of projects without overwhelming them with an extensive initial display.
- [ ] Integration of icons to represent the software tools and technologies used in each project (e.g., canvas, React, HTML, Java, etc.).
